# Lessons learned building a cloud-native architecture in .NET

This repository contains samples (.NET / C#) that I use in my presentation *Lessons learned building a cloud-native architecture in .NET*. 

The session will give an insight into the way .NET Core was used for implementing several cloud-native systems using DDD, the CQRS pattern and event-sourcing for storing state. It will cover the rationale behind the choices made and the lessons learned while designing and building this system. The session will cover both concepts as well as code.

## DISCLAIMER

The code in this repository is only used for experimenting with the architectural concepts DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing and for demos during the presentation. It is NOT production grade code, functionality is not complete (and may not even work correctly). Take this into account when just copying and pasting code from this repo into your own code-base (which is never a good idea by the way).

Because this is an experimental code, I will not accept issues or PRs on this repository.
